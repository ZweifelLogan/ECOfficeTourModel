This is a little representation I made in python of your interactive office tour just as a way to show you and everyone else there
    that I got the necessary skills for the job.

For actually navigating the program, the Welcome Desk is the main hub of the game. It is how you access all the data as well as the
    individual exhibits on the tour.
    
In the Welcome Center the commands (things you type in when prompted) are current, database, create and switch
    To "travel" to individual exhibits type in the name of the exhibit from the list printed when arriving in the Welcome Center.
    inputting an exit or quit command in the Welcome Center will terminate the program.

Each exhibit is different so the directions that pop up when "travelling" to an exhibit will explain what you can do their by using commands
    generally, typing in returnToHub will take you back to the Welcome Center so you can exit the program, examine data, or switch to a new profile/data entry.

All these instructions are also printed during the execution of the program so hopefully I left little room for confusion. Thanks for taking
    the time out of your day to look this over.
